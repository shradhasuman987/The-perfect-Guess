# The-perfect-Guess
Project Description

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess the number. The program provides feedback if the guessed number is too high or too low, and tracks the number of attempts it takes to correctly guess the number.

How It Works

The program uses the random module to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.

The player is prompted to enter their guess.

The program provides feedback:

If the guess is too high, it prompts the player to guess a lower number.

If the guess is too low, it prompts the player to guess a higher number.

The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.
